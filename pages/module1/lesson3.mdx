# Lesson 3: Fundamentals of Sequencing

## Overview
Sequencing is the heart of music production with Digitakt and Digitone. Understanding sequencing fundamentals allows you to build engaging patterns, layer tracks effectively, and bring your musical ideas to life.

### **What You'll Learn:**
- The differences between step, grid, and live recording modes.
- How to navigate and structure patterns effectively.
- Using parameter locks and conditional trigs for variation.
- Practical exercises for rhythm and melody programming.
- Performance strategies for live improvisation.

## 1. Step, Grid, and Live Recording Modes
Digitakt and Digitone provide three primary ways to input sequences:

### **1.1 Step Recording Mode**
- Enter notes manually by stepping through the sequence.
- Useful for precise programming of drum patterns and melodies.

**Exercise:**
1. Enter step recording mode (`REC` + `GRID`).
2. Input a basic kick drum pattern:

<Sequencer 
  variant="digitakt" 
  activeSteps={[{ step: 1, type: 'red' }, { step: 5, type: 'red' }, { step: 9, type: 'red' }, { step: 13, type: 'red' }]} 
/>

### **1.2 Grid Recording Mode**
- Play and record trigs while the sequencer is running.
- Great for live groove creation and experimentation.
- Grid mode allows for quantization settings to be adjusted, affecting timing accuracy and groove feel.

**Quantization Options:**
- **OFF:** Perfect for humanized, loose timing.
- **50%:** Balances live feel with some correction.
- **100%:** Snaps to grid for precise timing.

**Exercise:**
1. Enter grid mode (`REC` + `PLAY`).
2. Add hi-hats manually while listening to playback.
3. Experiment with different quantization settings to hear their effect on groove.
4. Use quantization creatively to create swing and shuffle.

### **1.3 Live Recording Mode**
- Capture real-time playing, including velocity and timing nuances.
- Ideal for expressive performances with external MIDI controllers.

**Exercise:**
1. Enable live recording mode (`REC` + `PLAY`).
2. Play a melody using the Digitakt/Digitoneâ€™s pads.
3. Adjust velocity sensitivity for dynamic expressiveness.

## 2. Understanding Pattern Structure
A solid grasp of pattern organization is essential for structuring your music effectively.

### **2.1 Patterns and Banks**
- **Patterns:** Contain track sequencing data and parameter automation.
- **Banks:** Store up to 16 patterns, allowing for easy project management.

**Tip:** Use different patterns for intros, breakdowns, and transitions.

### **2.2 Track Length and Scale Settings**
- Set individual track lengths to create polymetric sequences.
- Adjust scale multipliers for speed variations.
- Utilize pattern chaining for longer compositions.

**Exercise:**
1. Set the kick track to 16 steps.
2. Set a melody track to 12 steps for polymetric effects.
3. Create different pattern variations and chain them.

## 3. Using Parameter Locks and Conditional Trigs
Parameter locks and trig conditions add variety and dynamism to your sequences.

### **3.1 Parameter Locks**
- Assign different parameter values to individual trigs.
- Use them to create evolving textures and automation.
- Copy and paste parameter locks across multiple steps to speed up workflow:
  1. Hold the step with the desired lock and press `[FUNC] + COPY`.
  2. Navigate to the target step and press `[FUNC] + PASTE`.

**Exercise:**
1. Apply a filter lock to step 5 of a melody sequence.
2. Use parameter locks to automate panning on hi-hats.
3. Copy and paste locked parameters to create rhythmic changes.
4. Experiment with locking effects such as reverb and delay sends.

### **3.2 Conditional Trigs**
- Add variation by setting conditions for step triggering.
- Examples include `1:2` (plays every second cycle) and `FILL` (only triggers during fills).

<Sequencer 
  variant="digitakt" 
  activeSteps={[{ step: 3, type: 'red' }, { step: 7, type: 'red' }]} 
/>

**Exercise:**
1. Add a snare hit with a `1:2` condition.
2. Introduce FILL trigs for live performance excitement.
3. Experiment with different trig conditions to create evolving patterns.

## 4. Advanced Sequencing Techniques
Once the basics are mastered, explore advanced methods to add depth to your patterns.

### **4.1 Polyrhythms and Polymeters**
- Create rhythms with varying track lengths.
- Experiment with odd step counts for evolving grooves.
- Combine different rhythmic subdivisions to create harmonic and percussive interplay.

**Exercise:**
1. Set track lengths to 16 and 15 steps respectively.
2. Observe how they drift apart over time.
3. Layer kick and melody patterns with contrasting lengths to create tension and release.

### **4.2 Microtiming Adjustments**
- Shift trigs slightly forward or backward for a humanized feel.
- Useful for adding swing to your sequences.

**Exercise:**
1. Nudge a snare slightly off-grid for a natural groove.
2. Use microtiming to add push-pull effect to hi-hats.
